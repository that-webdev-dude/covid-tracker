# Covid Tracker

### React Web Application

COVID Tracker is a [React](https://react.dev/) based application that allows users to track COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide, by searching for Countries.

Due to the unavailability of current COVID-19 APIs, the app utilizes mock data to simulate the real-time statistics. However, the app's functionality and user interface accurately represent what could be achieved with live data.

The app features an autocomplete component built from scratch where the user selects the desired Country stats.
The Country stats are laid out in a card component which includes data from cases, deaths (total and relative to the current day), and a line chart where the daily evolution is described from the daily cases and deaths curves. The charts are smoothly animated and interactive.

One notable feature of the COVID Tracker app is the pin functionality. Users can bookmark their favorite statistics by Country, enabling them to access the data quickly without searching again. This feature is particularly useful for users who want to track specific countries or monitor changes in their preferred locations.

The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to find the information they need.
